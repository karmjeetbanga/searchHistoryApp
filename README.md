# searchHistoryApp

Build a simple application that allows users to search this JSON data set of historical events.


Basic Functionality

Users can enter search terms into a text field. Historical events that match the search terms are
displayed as a list.

● The JSON data can either be embedded into the application or fetched over the network

● Use of third-party libraries is fine, though of course it’s your own code that we’ll be
looking at

Extra Credit

features, or come up with your own idea…

● Real time update

● Imperfect matches (e.g. allowing for differences in whitespace, spelling etc.)

● Auto-complete

● Ordering results by quality of match

● ....or any other cool feature you can think of
